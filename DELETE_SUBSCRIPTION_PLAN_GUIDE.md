# üóëÔ∏è Delete Subscription Plan - Complete Guide

## ‚úÖ Implementation Status: 100% WORKING

The delete functionality for subscription plans is now **fully implemented and tested** with robust error handling, multiple key format support, and comprehensive logging.

---

## üéØ Features Implemented

### ‚úÖ Frontend (SubscriptionPlansManagement.tsx)

1. **Enhanced Delete Button**
   - Clear visual indication (Trash icon)
   - Disabled when loading
   - Available for each plan in the table

2. **Comprehensive Confirmation**
   - Bilingual warning (Arabic + English)
   - Shows plan name being deleted
   - Clear warning that action cannot be undone
   - User-friendly message format

3. **Robust Error Handling**
   - Session validation
   - Network timeout protection (10 seconds)
   - Specific error messages
   - Server response validation
   - Graceful failure handling

4. **State Management**
   - Loading state during deletion
   - Immediate UI update on success
   - localStorage sync
   - Global event notification for other components
   - Cache invalidation

5. **User Feedback**
   - Success toast with plan name
   - Error toast with specific details
   - Console logging for debugging
   - Visual feedback during operation

### ‚úÖ Backend (index.tsx)

1. **Multi-Format Key Support**
   - Tries multiple key formats:
     - Direct ID (e.g., `plan_xxx`)
     - With `plan_` prefix
     - With `subscription_plan_` prefix (legacy)
   - Automatically finds correct format
   - Logs which key was used

2. **Plan Existence Validation**
   - Checks all possible key formats
   - Returns 404 with helpful details if not found
   - Lists all attempted keys in error message

3. **Safe Deletion**
   - Only deletes after confirming plan exists
   - Uses actual key found (not assumed format)
   - Atomic operation

4. **Cache Management**
   - Invalidates plans cache after deletion
   - Ensures fresh data on next request
   - Prevents stale cache issues

5. **Audit Logging**
   - Records who deleted the plan
   - Timestamps the action
   - Stores plan name and ID
   - Includes which key format was deleted
   - Graceful failure if audit fails

6. **Response Format**
   - `success: true` on successful delete
   - Returns deleted plan details
   - Includes which key was actually deleted
   - Clear error messages on failure

## üìñ How to Use

### From UI (Recommended)

1. **Navigate to Plans Management**
   - Login as Super Admin
   - Go to System Admin Portal
   - Click on "Organizations & Plans" tab
   - Select "Plans" sub-tab

2. **Delete a Plan**
   - Find the plan you want to delete in the table
   - Click the üóëÔ∏è (Trash) icon in the Actions column
   - Read the confirmation dialog carefully
   - Click "OK" to confirm deletion
   - Wait for success message

3. **Verify Deletion**
   - Plan disappears from the table
   - Toast notification confirms success
   - Page data refreshes automatically
   - Deleted plan no longer appears in dropdowns

### From Code/API

```typescript
// Example: Delete a plan programmatically
async function deletePlan(planId: string) {
  const { data: { session } } = await supabase.auth.getSession();
  
  const response = await fetch(
    `https://${projectId}.supabase.co/functions/v1/make-server-6eefa08e/admin/plans/${planId}`,
    {
      method: 'DELETE',
      headers: {
        'Authorization': `Bearer ${session.access_token}`,
        'Content-Type': 'application/json'
      }
    }
  );
  
  const result = await response.json();
  
  if (result.success) {
    console.log('‚úÖ Plan deleted:', result.planName);
    console.log('Deleted key:', result.deletedKey);
  } else {
    console.error('‚ùå Delete failed:', result.error);
  }
  
  return result;
}
```

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Issue: "Plan not found" but plan exists in UI

**Cause:** Key format mismatch  
**Solution:** The backend now automatically tries all common key formats. If still failing, check the exact key in KV store.

**Debug Steps:**
1. Open browser console
2. Check the DELETE request URL
3. Look for `"Found plan with key: xxx"` in logs
4. Verify the key format matches what's in KV store

### Issue: Delete succeeds but plan still shows

**Cause:** Cache not invalidating or localStorage stale  
**Solution:** 
```typescript
// Manual cache clear
localStorage.removeItem('kueue_subscription_plans');
location.reload();
```

### Issue: "No active session" error

**Cause:** Session expired  
**Solution:** 
1. Logout and login again
2. Check browser console for auth errors
3. Verify Supabase connection

### Issue: Audit log creation fails

**Cause:** KV store limit or permission issue  
**Solution:** 
- This is non-critical (deletion still succeeds)
- Check server logs for audit error details
- Verify KV store has space

## üìù Code Examples

### Delete from React Component

```typescript
import { toast } from 'sonner@2.0.3';

const handleDeleteClick = async (planId: string) => {
  // Confirmation
  const confirmed = window.confirm(
    `Delete plan ${planId}?\nThis cannot be undone.`
  );
  
  if (!confirmed) return;
  
  setLoading(true);
  
  try {
    // Get session
    const { data: { session } } = await supabase.auth.getSession();
    
    // Call delete endpoint
    const response = await fetch(
      `https://${projectId}.supabase.co/functions/v1/make-server-6eefa08e/admin/plans/${planId}`,
      {
        method: 'DELETE',
        headers: {
          'Authorization': `Bearer ${session.access_token}`
        },
        signal: AbortSignal.timeout(10000)
      }
    );
    
    const result = await response.json();
    
    if (!response.ok || !result.success) {
      throw new Error(result.error || 'Delete failed');
    }
    
    // Update local state
    setPlans(prev => prev.filter(p => p.id !== planId));
    
    // Show success
    toast.success('Plan deleted successfully!');
    
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Delete error:', error);
    toast.error(error.message || 'Failed to delete plan');
  } finally {
    setLoading(false);
  }
};
```

### Delete from Server/Backend

```typescript
// Example: Cleanup old plans
async function cleanupOldPlans() {
  const allPlans = await kv.getByPrefix('plan_');
  const now = Date.now();
  const oneYearAgo = now - (365 * 24 * 60 * 60 * 1000);
  
  for (const item of allPlans) {
    const plan = JSON.parse(item.value);
    const createdAt = new Date(plan.created_at).getTime();
    
    if (createdAt < oneYearAgo && plan.status === 'inactive') {
      await kv.del(item.key);
      console.log(`üóëÔ∏è Deleted old inactive plan: ${plan.name}`);
    }
  }
}
```

    expect(response.success).toBe(true);
    expect(response.planId).toBe('plan_test_123');
  });
  
  it('should return 404 for non-existent plan', async () => {
    const response = await deletePlan('plan_nonexistent');
    expect(response.error).toBe('Plan not found');
