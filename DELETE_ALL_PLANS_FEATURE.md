**Features:**
- ✅ Authenticates user with access token
- ✅ Fetches all plans from KV store using `kv.getByPrefix('plan_')`
- ✅ Permanently deletes ALL plans
- ✅ Returns deletion count
- ✅ Does NOT create new plans (unlike `/cleanup` endpoint)

**Response:**

{
  "success": true,
  "message": "All plans deleted successfully",
  "deletedCount": 21
}
```

### 2. Frontend Component

```

    description: error.message || 'An unexpected error occurred'
  });
}
```

### Backend
```typescript
try {
  // Delete operations
} catch (error) {

## Logging

### Frontend Logs
- 🗑️ DELETING ALL PLANS...
- ✅ All plans deleted: {result}
- ❌ Failed to delete all plans: {error}

### Backend Logs
- 🔑 Verifying token for delete all plans...
- ✅ Token verified for user: {email}

- 📦 Found {count} plan entries in KV store
- 🗑️ DELETED plan: {planKey}
- ✅ DELETE ALL COMPLETE: Removed {count} plans from system

## Migration Path

### Current State
- 21 plans in database (duplicates/invalid)
- Should only have 4 default plans

### Recommended Action
1. Use **"Reset Plans"** button (easier, one-step)
   - Automatically cleans up and creates defaults
   
OR

2. Use **"Delete All Plans"** then **"Reset Plans"** (two-step)
   - More control, but requires two actions

## Files Modified

2. `/components/OrganizationsAndPlans.tsx` - UI updates
